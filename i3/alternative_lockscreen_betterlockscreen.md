# Alternative lockscreen "betterlockscreen"

The i3 Window Manager recommends to use the lockscreen application "i3lock" which is a nice way of locking the screen of a device but i wanted something with a more "modern" design and found "betterlockscreen" in a reddit post.

The repository for betterlockscreen can be found [here](https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen)

## Installation Tipps 

All the necessary information can be found in the tutorial in the repository. On Ubuntu 18.04 all the requirements were allready installed except [i3lock-color](https://github.com/codejamninja/i3lock-color-ubuntu) (which is a interesting fork of i3color) for which i had to uninstall i3lock and used a community repository to install it which can be found [here](https://github.com/PandorasFox/i3lock-color) (I take no responsibility for safety).
