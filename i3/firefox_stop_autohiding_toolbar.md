# How to stop Firefox from autohiding the Toolbar

When i am using i3 i like to enter firefox in the fullscreen mode. But to maximise screen space firefox auto hides the toolbar which i would like to keep. This change in the ```about:config``` page which you can enter from typing it in the url. You have the boolean value of

```browser.fullscreen.autohide```

to false.
