# File Manager for the Command Line

My preferred file manager for the command line is ```ranger```, its written in phyton so its a little bit slower the other cli file managers but i really like it. 

An the best thing is that it behaves similar to vim so you can use ```h,j,k,l``` for moving around. 

## Installation 

To install ranger on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine i just had to type in 
```
sudo apt-get install ranger 
```
