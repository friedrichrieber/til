# How to use the build in command search feature

I noticed that a lot of people dont know about the recursive command search in bash. Its

```bash
CTRL+R
```

Alternatively you can of course use the good old ```history``` and ```grep``` combo, e.g.

```bash
history | grep test

```

which finds all commands of the last bash session with the keyword test in it.
