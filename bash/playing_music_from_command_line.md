# Playing Music from the command line

In my ongoing journey of trying to do everything in the terminal i reached the point where i want to play music from it. My solution is a programm called cmus which i installed on my Ubuntu 18.04 Machine with:
```
sudo apt install cmus
```
and i was done. In order to play music you have to add it first which happens if you press the ":" button and enter: 
```
add MUSIC_DIRECTORY
```

## Using Cmus 

To toggle between album/artist and the actual songs you use the ```TAB-BUTTON``` and to move around you use the typical vim buttons ```h,j,k,l```.
